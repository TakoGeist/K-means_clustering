# K-means Clustering

<p> Performance analysis of the K-means clustering based on Lloyid's algorithm on single thread single core application with use of vector operations, 
  single socket multiple thread <code>MPI</code> implementation and Cuda based GPU application for use of highly parallel computational resources.</p>
  
  ## K-means sequential
  Single core, single thread application with use of modules such as AVG2, AVG, etc. in order to reduce instruction count and improve computational time.
  ## K-means Parallel MPI
  Single socket, multiple thread, single process application using <code>MPI</code> to manage parallelization of the computaional workload.
  ## K-means Cuda
  GPU based computational allows for highly parallel computation resulting in a decrease of computational time.
